The purpose of this project is to use feature engineering to generate new information that can be used in a classification model to determine which player is speaking. In other words, provided a player line, ideally the model will be able to predict which player is speaking."

    "By observing the data visually, it is apparent there are missing values throughout the data. This will require cleaning, which will be completed next. In order to establish additional value, I would like to aggregate the PlayerLines into single rows so that each player's consecutive lines will be stored as a single quote. Once I have completed this aggregation, I can come up with useful variables based on that quote that will be used as features in the classification model. A few ideas that come to mind are: number of words per player line, average sentence length (per player line), number of sentences per player line."

    "I use 2 methods for classification: Decision tree, and Random forest. I chose to use decision tree because of the ease of interpretation and visualization. Provided more time I would have liked to visualize the tree itself. I then wanted to run a random forest because it is a more robust version of decision trees (since it uses many trees as opposed to just one). Since my features are numerical I envisioned a decision tree where: if the playerLine has less than average number of words in the quote (the average words per quote is 35 as seen above) go left, otherwise go right. And as you navigate down the tree using the features and categorizations of said features you narrow the Player possibilities until you have a few left. There is one line spoken by the chorus that is 1555 words, so we would know if we follow this hypothetical decision tree to the right all the way we would find 'chorus' as the speaker. \n",
    "\n",
    "The results for both methods are very inaccurate, as seen below: the accuracy for both is around 0.7%. The reason for this is most likely because of the features I chose. All 3 features are fairly similar since they all deal with the length of the Playerline and therefore impart similar information to the model. Again provided more time I would have liked to create more features that impart better/more information to the models. I believe the accuracy rate of both were similar because: if the decision tree is already inaccurate, lots of decision trees via random forest aren't going to produce better results.\n",

    "Overall, I spent most of my time cleaning the data, altering the layout of the data, and engineering new features from that data. Provided more time I would have liked to come up with better features as discussed earlier and use more classification models such as logistic regression. Some features that I thought of but didn't have time to implement were: Player speaking frequency variable (based on the number of lines they had in the play), a unique ID for each play (since plays are stored as strings here), a most used word variable (a measure of which players used popular words more often). Additionally, I would have liked to apply the classification models to smallers subsets of data (ie single plays) as opposed to the whole dataset. "
